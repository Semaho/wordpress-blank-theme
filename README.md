# WordPress Blank Theme

> âš  **Nothing** will be shown after activating this theme, and this is normal. This a starting point, a boilerplate for custom theme development. You'd better know your [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://wphierarchy.com/) and start coding !

## Installation

Prerequisites :

- NodeJS
- Sass (Ruby)
- Gulp

Go to theme folder in your Terminal, run once `npm install` for dependencies.

Run `gulp` to listen to sass and javascript files.  
They will be compiled in `/assets/dist/` folder, respectively in `css/style.min.css` and `js/scripts.min.js`.
